# prophet-challenge
This was the most challenging assignment as it was due around the same time we started our project 1 work and I spent more time on that analysis and am now playing catchup. 

It was also unique in that while we had similar assignments during class I could reference, I struggled initially as I was working on VS, not Colab when I first started working on the solution which caused a lot of errors as I was trying to figure out what I needed to install for the charts to work. Once I joined office hours and we went through the code I realized I was using the wrong tool. 

I started the assignment as I normally do;
- Revew which class activities are similar to assignment.
- Copy/paste relevant code
- Check for syntax errors and make corrections
- Attend office hours & correct problems.
